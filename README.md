This script generates a HTML report for Google Scholar Alerts by reading your emails from your Mail.app (only for macOS)

Usage: `bash run.sh`

You should change the email address in the script, and also optionally change the email sending method in `send_email()` (by default I use remote iCloud mail server and the password is saved in a file called 'MAIL_PASSWORD' in this directory).
